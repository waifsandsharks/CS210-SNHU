(The Zoo) 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This program was designed for Wildlife zoo, the problem it was created to solve was creating a program that communicates with Java to create data records save and edit them.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I thought the project was organized particularly well, I liked that each of the classes were separated with header and source files and were still able to work together including the java implementation.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I think a display that shows the tracking numbers when entering a new one would be helpful. This would allow a user to see if the tracking number they're entering already exists and for what animal when the program throws an error.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I used a lot of external resources online for example a form and tutorial on Cplusplus to see how other people handled and worked with situations. I know moving forward if I have questions or need help I can always find assistance on forums like Stackoverflow or CPlusPlus outside of colleagues in my field.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  I think the Java implementation and writing and editing files in a different language will be super helpful.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
  I ensured that I added adequate notation and made the program easily readable. The Classes were all separated with source and header files.
